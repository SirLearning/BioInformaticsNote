Syracuse University's cybersecurity course, supported by a $1.3 million grant from the NSF, has developed hands-on practical lab exercises known as SEED Labs. This course emphasizes both theoretical instruction and practical hands-on experience, providing detailed open-source lecture materials, video tutorials, textbooks printed in multiple languages, and ready-to-use attack and defense environments based on virtual machines and Docker. Currently, 1,050 research institutions worldwide are using this project.

It covers a wide range of topics in the field of computer and information security, including software security, network security, web security, operating system security, and mobile application security.
